# Async append only log

This module is heavily inspired by [flumelog-aligned-offset]. It is an
attempt to implement the same concept but in a simpler fashion, making
it easier to reason about the code. A log is the lowest part of the
SSB stack, so it should extremly stable while still maintaining good
performance.

A log consists of a number of `blocks`, that contain a number of
`record`s. A `record` is simply it's `length`, as a 16-bit unsigned
integer, followed by the `data` bytes. A record must be in one and
only one block, which means there probably will be some empty space at
the end of a block.  Blocks are always written in full.

```
<block>
  <record
    <length: UInt16LE>
    <data: Bytes>
  </record>*
</block>*
```

In contrast to flumelog-aligned-offset there is no additional `length`
after the `data` in a `record` and no pointer at the end of a
`block`. These were there to be able to iterate over the log in
reverse, but I have never seen the need for that.

Writing to the log is always async. Note this is different from
[flumelog-offset] and [flumelog-aligned-offset]. The `since`
observable will be updated once the data is written. The `onDrain`
callback can be used to know when data has been written if
needed. Streaming will only emit values that have been written to
storage. This is to ensure that a view will never get ahead of the
main log and thus end up in a bad state if the system crashes before
data is written. `get` will return values that have not been written
to disk yet.

This module is not compatible with flume without a wrapper around
stream as it uses the same terminology as [JITDB] and [ssb-db2] of
using offset for the byte position of a record instead of seq.

## Options

```
var OffsetLog = require('async-flumelog')
var log = OffsetLog('/data/log', {
  blockSize: 1024,          // default is 1024*64
  codec: {encode, decode}   // defaults to no codec, expects buffers. for json use flumecodec/json
  writeTimeout: 100         // default is 250. Amount of time to wait between writes
  validateRecord: (d) => {} // default is no validate. A custom function that takes a message and
                            // runs a custom validation to ensure the record is valid.
                            // On load, all records in the latest block will be checked using this
})
```

## Benchmarks

Running [bench-flumelog] reveals the following numbers. Async flumelog
is faster that regular flumelog-offset in all categories. The most
important numbers are append (used for onboarding) and stream (used
for building indexes). Flumelog-aligned-offset is not included in the
benchmarks, as it writes every message synchronously rendering the
results invalid.

```
async flumelog:

random, 28774.712, 4.298, 287891, 43.008, 10.005
```

To run the benchmarks the small `bench-flumelog.patch` needs to be
applied.
