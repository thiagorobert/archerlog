# SSB browser core

Secure scuttlebutt core (similar to [ssb-server]) in a browser.

This is a full implementation of ssb running in the browser only (but
not limited to, of course). The key of your feed is stored in the
browser together with the log, indexes and smaller images. To reduce
storage and network requirements, partial replication has been
implemented. Wasm is used for crypto and is around 90% the speed of
the C implementation. A WebSocket is used to connect to pubs or
rooms. The `bundle-core.js` file in dist/ is roughly 2mb.

Replication in the browser is quite a bit slower than in node, around
2x. There doesn't seem to be a single cause, it appears to be all the
diferrent layers that are [slower]: end-to-end encryption, database
write etc.

SSB conn is used for connections and rooms are supported. Partial
replication is implemented which allows two connected browsers to do a
partial sync.

Partial replication [speed] on a fast laptop is roughly 425 feeds in 56
seconds, and roughly half of that on a slow laptop or when running on
battery.

# api

Once you load the `bundle-core.js` file in a browser a global SSB
object will be available.

The api is not meant to be 100% compatible with regular
ssb-db. Overall there are two major parts: [`db`](#db) and
[`net`](#net).

If you use ssb-browser-core in an app where the user can open multiple
tabs, it is *highly* recommended to use the ssb-singleton as you
otherwise will corrupt your database.

I highly recommend looking at [ssb-browser-demo] for an example of how
this library can be used to build applications.

# config

Loading the bundle-core file as above will use `browser.js`, meaning
default options. It is also possible to overwrite config options,
like:

```
require('../core.js').init(dir, { blobs: { max: 512 * 1024 } }, extraModules)
```

Default config options are defined in `net.js`.

`extraModules` is a function that takes a secret stack and attaches
extra modules. This allow you to add db2 indexes or extra plugins like
ssb-threads.

DHT connections are enabled by default. If you don't want that, you
can configure `connections` to not include DHT in incoming and
outgoing.

## db

This is the [ssb-db2] module.

## net

This is the [secret-stack] module with a few extra modules
loaded. [ssb-ws] is used to create web socket connections to pubs.

### id

The public key of the current user

### rpc:connect event

Example:

```
SSB.net.on('rpc:connect', (rpc) => {
  console.log("connected")
  rpc.on('closed', () => console.log("bye"))
})
```

### connectAndRemember(addr, data)

Will connect and store as to automatically reconnect on
reload. Options are as described in [ssb-conn].

### directConnect(addr, cb)

Connect to addr only once. Cb is (err, rpc)

### blobs

This is where the `blobs` api can be found. The module implements the
blobs protocol and so can exchange blobs with connection peers. It
also contains with the the following extra methods:

#### hash(data, cb)

Hashes data and returns the digest or err

Example:
```
onFileSelect: function(ev) {
  const file = ev.target.files[0]
  file.arrayBuffer().then(function (buffer) {
    SSB.net.blobs.hash(new Uint8Array(buffer), (err, digest) => {
      console.log(digest)
    })
  })
}
```

#### add(blobId, file, cb)

Adds the `file` (such as one obtained from ev.target.files when using
a file select) to the blob store using the blobId name. BlobId is & +
hash.

#### remoteURL(blobId)

Returns a http URL string for the current connection. This is useful
in a browser for images that you don't want to store directly on the
device.

#### privateGet(blobId, unbox, cb)

Callback with err or a url that works for e.g images that was received
in a private message.

#### localGet(blobId, unbox, cb)

If blob already exists will callback with err or a url that can be
used for images for a blob. Otherwise the blob will get requested and
if size is smaller than the maximum size, the blob will be stored
locally and used for callback, otherwise the callback will return a
`remoteURL` link.

### ooo

The [ssb-ooo] module

### Browser specific methods on net

For partial replication a special plugin has been created and
implemented in browser core, other clients such as a pub needs to have
the [ssb-partial-replication] plugin installed.

Once a rpc connection has been established, a few extra methods are
available under SSB.net.partialReplication. See plugin for
documentation.

## SSB

Other things directly on the global SSB object

### dir

The path to where the database and blobs are stored.

### getPeer()

Gets one of the connected peers that is not a room server.

### getGraphForFeed(feed, cb)

Returns an object of: following, blocking and extended given the feed.

### box

[box](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-keys#boxcontent-recipients--boxed)
method from ssb-keys. Useful for private messages.

### blobFiles

The [ssb-blob-files] module.

### SSB: loaded event

Because loading wasm is async, an event will be fired when `SSB` is
ready to use. Example:

```
SSB.events.on('SSB: loaded', function() {
  console.log("ready to rock!")
})
```

There are a few other undocumented methods, these will probably be
moved to another module in a later version as they are quite tied to
[ssb-browser-demo].

# SSB Singleton

Several of the libraries we use (such as db2 and
async-append-only-log) are not thread-safe.  This poses problems for
apps written using ssb-browser-core because you, as a developer, have
no control over the number of concurrent tabs a user can have open.
This causes all kinds of problems with data corruption.

Enter SSB Singleton.

SSB Singleton uses a localStorage-based mutex system and timeouts to
ensure that one (and only one) SSB object is active for the same
origin at any given time.  SSB Singleton can also manage coordinating
multiple windows so that child windows can use their parent window's
SSB object instead of just failing to acquire a lock.

This does result in a slight delay upon startup where it checks for
open locks.  So we've provided several ways to be notified when SSB
has been initialized.  Here is a rough idea of how the API works:

## SSB Singleon API

### `setup(dir, config, extraModules, ssbLoaded)`

Initialize the SSB Singleton module. Does *not* actually trigger the
initialization of SSB (see `getSSBEventually`). This is required to be
called before trying to access SSB.

* `dir` - *String*, A name like "/.ssb-lite".
* `config` - *Object*, configuration object to pass through to `ssb-browser-core/core`'s `init` function.
* `extraModules` - *Function (optional)*, function to call to add more modules to the SecretStack during initialization - passed through to `ssb-browser-core/core`'s `init` function.
* `ssbLoaded` - *Function*, function which is called if we are the primary controller window and SSB is completely done initializing.  No parameters are passed - it is just a notification function to let you know that our window has just initialized an SSB object, in case any other initialization steps have to be done.


### `init(config, extraModules, ssbLoaded)`

Similar to setup. Defaults to "/.ssb-lite" as dir, because of this it
is recommended to use setup instead so multiple apps on the same
domain can choose their own store!

### `onChangeSSB(cb)`

Register a callback which is called when the primary controller window
changes and SSB has been reinitialized.  The intended use is for
things like pull streams to be able to reinitialize themselves.  The
list of callbacks is not cleared when the controller changes, so you
only need to register here once to be notified every time a change
happens.

* `cb` - *Function*, callback with zero parameters to be called when the primary controller changes.

### `onError(cb)`

Register a callback which is called when an error occurs in trying to
access SSB, such as if we're waiting for a lock or otherwise cannot
acquire an SSB.  The intended use of this is to display an error to
the user.  The list of callbacks is not cleared when an error occurs,
so you only need to register here once.

* `cb` - *Function*, callback with zero parameters to be called when an error occurs in acquiring an SSB object.

### `onSuccess(cb)`

Register a callback which is called when SSB has been successfully
acquired within our window/tab.  The intended use of this is to hide
error messages shown by `onError` callbacks.  The list of callbacks is
not cleared when SSB is successfully acquired, so expect your callback
to be called many, many times over the course of the application's
operation.  Keep your callback short, sweet, and to the point.

* `cb` - *Function*, callback with zero parameters to be called when an SSB object has been successfully acquired.  Does not provide the actual SSB object - this is strictly a notification function.

### `getSSB() => [ err, SSB ]`

Attempt to get an SSB object and immediately fail if it is not
available.  If the SSB object is available, `err` will be null and
`SSB` will contain the SSB object.  Even if it's not yet fully and
completely initialized yet, whatever is available will be returned.
If an SSB object is not available, `err` will contain a String reason
why.

### `getSSBEventually(timeout, isRelevantCB, ssbCheckCB, resultCB)`

Asynchronous function to keep trying to get an SSB object, even if one
is not currently available.

* `timeout` - *Number*, number of milliseconds to keep trying to get an SSB object before giving up and timing out with an error.  Pass a negative value to disable timing out and keep trying indefinitely.
* `isRelevantCB` - *Function*, callback function which is called with zero arguments and is expected to return a boolean value of whether or not the caller still needs an SSB object.  This can be used, for example, to bail on running calls to `getSSBEventually` when a Vue component using it has been unloaded, so we don't waste resources retrying forever.
* `ssbCheckCB` - *Function*, since `getSSBEventually` might be called while an SSB object is still initializing, this function is called to ask whether what we have for an SSB object is initiailized enough to use.  The function is passed what we have for an SSB and is expected to return a boolean value for whether it's good enough to use.  A callback like this might want to return something like `(SSB && SSB.db)` or `(SSB && SSB.net)`.
* `resultCB` - *Function*, function which takes two arguments `(err, SSB)` which is called when either there's an error, a timeout, or we successfully acquired an SSB and it has been declared suitable by `ssbCheckCB`.  Basically the only situation this is not called for an end result is if `isRelevantCB` returns false.

### `getSimpleSSBEventually(isRelevantCB, resultCB)`

Shorthand easy version of `getSSBEventually`. Retries indefinitely
(without timing out) and assumes that an SSB which has initialized its
database is suitable for your use (see `ssbCheckCB` for how this
works).

* `isRelevantCB` - Passed through.  See `getSSBEventually` for more information.
* `resultCB` - Passed through.  See `getSSBEventually` for more information.

### `openWindow(href)`

Since we can only have one SSB object active, if we want child windows
to be able to operate concurrently with us, we need to be able to
coordinate with other windows.  This function programmatically opens a
new window and adds the new window's handle to a tracking list so that
child windows can coordinate with their parent window's SSB as well as
other windows within the same family in case the parent window is
closed and a new SSB holder needs to be elected.  In other words, for
best results, make sure that everything in your app which can open a
window calls this function.

* `href` - *String*, URL to open in the new window, just like you would normally pass to `window.open`.

# Browser compatibility

Tested with Chrome and Firefox. Chrome is faster because it uses fs
instead of indexeddb. Also tested on android using Chrome and iOS
using safari.

# Building

Run `npm run build` for debugging and `npm run release` for a smaller
dist file.

For a smaller bundle file you can apply (patch -p0 < x.patch):
